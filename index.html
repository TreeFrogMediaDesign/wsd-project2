			<article id="top">
				<p>Located in the great Northwest in beautiful Kuna, Idaho, Indian Creek Ranch is located on 474 diverse acres in tradional big sheep and cattle country.</p>
				<p>Kuna, with it's population of 15,210 people, is made up of rolling hills with sagebrush, native grasses, countless springs, draws with hawthorn trees, chokecherry trees, wild current bushes and wild roses. Indian Creek is a small seasonal creek that runs through the city and proivdes a few good swimming holes for the local residents. Another attraction to the area is an underground lava flow cave, commonly referred to simply as "Kuna Caves". This is located out in an area known as "The Birds of Prey", home to the endangered peregrin falcon.</p>
				<p>Kuna originated as a railroad stop with coach transport to Boise. It is popularly believed that the translation of "Kuna" means "the end of the trail", but in a memoir of Charles S. Walgamott's adventures in the lates 1800s in southern Idaho, cites that the origin of the name as a Shoshone Indian word meaning "green leaf, good to smoke".
				<p>This is truly gorgeous country &amp; we know that we are truly blessed beyond measure to live here.</p>

The outcome of this mating has resulted in a most incredible equine with the intelligence, hair and hardiness of the Gypsy and the size, movement and elegance of the Friesian. The Gypsian is the result of melding the sought after characterisitics of two incredible breeds into one. Presently the Gypsian is growing in numbers and popularity both in the United States and in Europe.</p>

They have abundant manes and tails with feather on lower legs. They are a large horse, often 16 hands, and are most often recognized by their black coloring. The Friesian is popular in both English and Western disciplines.</p>

Gypsy horses are most known for the presence, flashy coloring and copious amounts of hair. Butwhere they Gypsy horse really shines is their extraordinary temperament and intelligence.</p>
				<p>The Gypsian horse is the spectacular result of combing a purebred, registered Friesian and a registered Gypsy horse. This extraordinary union has the elegant movement, presence and gracefulness from the Friesian, melded with the hair, hardiness and termperament of the Gypsy, wrapped in a multitude of diverse colors.</p>
