				<p>Located in the great Northwest in beautiful Kuna, Idaho, Indian Creek Ranch is located on 474 diverse acres in tradional big sheep and cattle country.</p>
				<p>Kuna, with it's population of 15,210 people, is made up of rolling hills with sagebrush, native grasses, countless springs, draws with hawthorn trees, chokecherry trees, wild current bushes and wild roses. Indian Creek is a small seasonal creek that runs through the city and proivdes a few good swimming holes for the local residents. Another attraction to the area is an underground lava flow cave, commonly referred to simply as "Kuna Caves". This is located out in an area known as "The Birds of Prey", home to the endangered peregrin falcon.</p>
				<p>Kuna originated as a railroad stop with coach transport to Boise. It is popularly believed that the translation of "Kuna" means "the end of the trail", but in a memoir of Charles S. Walgamott's adventures in the lates 1800s in southern Idaho, cites that the origin of the name as a Shoshone Indian word meaning "green leaf, good to smoke".
				<p>This is truly gorgeous country &amp; we know that we are truly blessed beyond measure to live here.</p>
